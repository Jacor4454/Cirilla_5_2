# Cirilla_5_2
an ANN library that does normal, recursion, pho-convolutional and LSTM networks


built in python for my A-level project,
it can make a recursive neural network for learning to add numbers,
pho-convolutional networks for doing digit recognition with the MNIST dataset,
and neat for playing flappybird


pho-convolutional by the way is my version convolutional subsampling 
(at the time I didnt have the knowhow to do it properly), 
where each sample uses a different sample,
rather than the same sample across the whole matrix
